- Data Mining
		- Analysis Of Depression Among Adolescents using Random Forest and Logistic Regression model
		- https://github.com/namansingh2623/Early-Detection-of-Depression
		- Designed and implemented machine learning models using Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict major depressive episodes with severe impairment (mdeSI) among adolescents.
		- Achieved robust model performance, with Random Forest attaining an AUC of 0.929 and Logistic Regression achieving an AUC of 0.901 on test data.
		- Identified key predictors, including gender, income, parental involvement, and school experiences, to support early intervention strategies in clinical and educational settings.
